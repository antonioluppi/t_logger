# t_logger
a simple fridge temperature monitor and data acquisition system. 
I used:

* two LM35 to sensor the external and internal temperature of the frigde;
* and Arduino Uno to acquire the signals and send throught the serial port to a computer;
* a computer running a python script to save the data to a csv file;
